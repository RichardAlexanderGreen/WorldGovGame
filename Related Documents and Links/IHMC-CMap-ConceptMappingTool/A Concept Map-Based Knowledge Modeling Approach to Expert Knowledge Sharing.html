      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An important 
        aspect of knowledge management is the implementation of methods to share 
        the idiosyncratic knowledge of expert practitioners within an organization. 
        In order to make such knowledge sharable, it is necessary to have both 
        an effective elicitation method and a useful representation scheme. In 
        this paper we describe the PreSERVe method of knowledge elicitation as 
        it is used with a knowledge representation scheme based upon concept maps 
        <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#1">[1]</a>. We describe the use of these methods in a case study 
        on the capture and representation of local weather forecasting knowledge.</font></p>

        Introduction</font></b></h1>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mission-critical 
        knowledge resides in the memories of experts and in a relatively small 
        subset of what are often distributed external resources that they use, 
        such as technical reports, manuals, books, online materials, etc. In this 
        paper, we describe an iterative method of eliciting expert knowledge called 
        PreSERVe - Prepare, Scope, Elicit, Render, Verify, that presents a principled 
        way to combine various knowledge elicitation strategies <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#2">[2</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#3">3]</a>. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PreSERVe method 
        was refined in work at NASA Glenn Research Center <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#10">[10]</a>. 
        The method supports the elicitation of idiosyncratic expert knowledge, 
        the identification of the most important knowledge-rich resources upon 
        which the expert relies, and the assembly of an incrementally evolving 
        representation of the expert's knowledge and problem-solving processes. 
        This method supports construction of an informal but semantically rich 
        representation of expert knowledge and the simultaneous creation and identification 
        of critical supplementary resources that materially augment the representation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Parallel work at 
        the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) (e.g., <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#9">[9</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#10">10</a>, <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#11">11]</a>) has led to the development 
        of a unique way to represent a domain of knowledge. The structure of what 
        we term a knowledge model is based upon concept maps <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#1">[1]</a>, 
        a major methodological tool of Ausubel's Assimilation Theory of meaningful 
        learning <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#12">[12]</a>. The representation scheme described here 
        is different from other less formal ones such as mind maps <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#4">[4]</a>, 
        knowledge maps <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#5">[5]</a>, and the like, in that it conveys 
        rich semantic content and also provides an organizing factor for other 
        resources and media that are added to the knowledge model. Also, PreSERVe 
        affords a more intuitive way to capture tacit knowledge than is required 
        by formal schemes such as conceptual graphs <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#6">[6]</a>, KADS 
        <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#7">[7]</a> and Ontolingua <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#8">[8]</a> models. The next 
        sections of this paper elaborate the PreSERVe method, the structure of 
        a knowledge model, and a case study from the domain of weather forecasting.</font><br>

      <h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">2. Knowledge Modeling 
        at the IHMC</font></h1>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        section presents a discussion of the PreSERVe method and of the Concept 
        Map-based knowledge modeling scheme originated at IHMC. Concept Maps are 
        graphs that are comprised of concepts (defined by Novak as perceived regularities 
        in objects and events) on the nodes and the relationships among the concepts 
        on the arcs. Concept Maps are used to form knowledge models by placing 
        them in a hierarchical organization and appending elaborating media onto 
        the nodes within each map. The entire knowledge model is linked together 
        through a general, subsuming top-level map. The resultant model of expert 
        knowledge contains numerous (i.e., hundreds) of domain concepts, principles, 
        and relations that are elicited from the expert, rendered, and verified 
        using the PreSERVe method. </font></p>
      <h2 align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2.1. 
        The PreSERVe Method</b></font></h2>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 
        1 depicts the PreSERVe method. It represents the process flow and the 
        flows of resources that are fashioned into the knowledge model. After 
        the initial preparation phase, the process flows are iterative. Preparation 
        has several aspects including the identification of the expert or experts, 
        the selection of the knowledge domain to be explored (if necessary), and 
        study of the domain by the knowledge engineer(s) who facilitate the process. 
        It is also critical to establish a rapport with the expert as part of 
        this phase.</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Figure 
        1. The PreSERVe method of knowledge modeling</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The need 
        to maintain and act upon an awareness of the potentially changing scope 
        and direction of the project is one of the major driving forces in defining 
        the PreSERVe method as an iterative process. For this reason, the method 
        represents, as a separate activity, the need to establish and regularly 
        reassess the scope of the endeavor. Experience has shown that a failure 
        to track the scope of a knowledge elicitation project in an ongoing fashion 
        can lead to a haphazard elicitation effort that may go in directions that 
        do not serve the goal of the project, and that may neglect areas that 
        are important to its goals. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The actual elicitation 
        of knowledge can take many forms that can be categorized broadly into 
        those that are direct (in collaboration with the expert) and indirect 
        (through study or inclusion of relevant information sources identified 
        by the expert or knowledge engineer) <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#13">[13]</a>. Direct methods 
        of knowledge elicitation are chosen from a variety of techniques based 
        upon interviews, analysis of familiar tasks, and so-called contrived (or 
        experiment-like) techniques <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#3">[3]</a>. The knowledge elicitation 
        process leads to the creation of artifacts (concept maps, interview transcriptions, 
        edited videos of the expert discussing a topic or making a point, etc.) 
        that will be included in the knowledge model.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rendering process 
        has two parts: The creation or editing of elements that will be included 
        in a knowledge model (resource rendering), and the assembly of these elements 
        into the knowledge model itself (model rendering). These and other pre-existing 
        resources that have been identified in the process (such as selected items 
        from the expert's reference material) are edited into a form that is sufficient 
        to convey what needs to be known about a topic in the model, and that 
        is suitable for presentation in the context of the knowledge model. The 
        complete set of edited resources is characterized as synthesized resources. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The verification 
        process must occur at both a mechanical and conceptual level. Ascertaining 
        that all the components can be found, that the links work (permitting 
        navigation through the media), and that the media display correctly, corresponds 
        to a mechanical verification. A conceptual or semantic verification (by 
        far, the more important of the two types) checks that the factual information 
        is correct and complete, that the best content available at the time is 
        included, that the structure, arrangement and retrieval mechanisms make 
        sense, and that gaps in the elicited knowledge have been filled and significant 
        redundancies avoided.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PreSERVe method 
        is iterative since the verification process can lead to the identification 
        of additional areas that should be explored (a change of scope), under-described 
        areas in which more comprehensive descriptions should be elicited, areas 
        where supplementary resources might create a more comprehensive account, 
        or components that need to be rearranged to make the model more coherent 
        or logical. Ultimately, a comprehensive, verified model is produced.</font><br>
      </p>
      <h2><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2.2 The Structure 
        of a Knowledge Model</b></font></h2>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PreSERVe method 
        involves structuring the knowledge model with the concept maps that were 
        elicited to define the scope and vernacular of the domain. Concept maps 
        provide an explicit, concise representation of what the expert knows about 
        a knowledge domain. Knowledge models are ordered in a semi-hierarchical 
        structure with a general, subsuming concept map at the top of the hierarchy 
        and more detailed maps at lower levels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 2 is a depiction 
        of part of a knowledge model pertaining to weather forecasting on the 
        Gulf Coast of Florida. As can be seen in Figure 2, the concepts within 
        the map are populated with icons that indicate sources of information 
        related to a given concept. An icon is provided for each of the various 
        information sources such as text, graphs, photos, digital audio or video, 
        links to Web pages, etc. The icons appear at the nodes in varying combinations 
        to indicate the media containing information regarding the concept, and 
        links to the concept in other maps or contexts. When the user clicks the 
        icon that represents one of these sources of information, a pop-up menu 
        appears that presents links to the media of the selected type. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A special icon representing 
        other concept maps in which a given concept appears is used to indicate 
        links within the model. Clicking that icon presents the user a pop-up 
        menu listing other locations to which the user might navigate. The overall 
        navigational scheme allows the user to start in a model at a given location 
        and view the occurrence of the concept in the other media by clicking 
        the appropriate icon. The user can also examine the other concepts and 
        links in the current map as they relate to the concept under consideration. 
        Since these facilities all occur in the context of a Concept Map set, 
        the user has great navigational flexibility throughout the knowledge model. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike the links 
        in Web-based browsers that convey no semantic content, the connections 
        among concepts in Concept Maps have explicit meanings in two distinct 
        forms <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#10">[10]</a>. The links between concepts within a single 
        map elaborate the relationships among the concepts in that map. In addition, 
        the linking mechanism that allows a concept in one Concept Map to be linked 
        to the same concept in another, provides the capability to browse more 
        general or more specific elaborations of the concept and to examine the 
        concept in varying contexts. A search capability enables the user of the 
        knowledge model to identify places in the model that contain information 
        on items of interest.</font></p>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Knowledge models 
        of this sort contain content that is different from the more general information 
        in typical reference material and that is organized quite differently 
        than standard (sequential) textbook knowledge or mainstream hypermedia 
        learning systems. These knowledge models tend to be large and complex 
        (reflecting the complexity of real domains of knowledge) with interwoven 
        themes and rich interconnections of the concepts based on the expert's 
        highly articulated mental model of the domain. As such, these knowledge 
        models contain highly contextualized, domain-specific knowledge that is 
        more directly applicable to specific problem situations than much of the 
        more generic knowledge that typically comprises instructional materials 
        or references.</font></p>
      <h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">3. An Example Knowledge 
        Model </font></h1>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The US Navy's meteorology 
        community has a number of interesting knowledge management problems. Theirs 
        is a domain that is characterized by an enormous number of data types 
        and information sources, with new ones continually becoming available. 
        Forecasters work under conditions of significant uncertainty with very 
        high stakes. Weather impacts on training and operational missions are 
        one of the most problematic areas the Navy faces. Furthermore, effects 
        of local conditions can have significant impact on the weather. Knowledge 
        of such local effects is gained by forecasters who have had extensive 
        experience in a particular locale. However, Naval meteorologists' careers 
        typically unfold as a succession of land-based duty stations and assignments 
        to the fleet, with an ongoing need to understand local effects on weather 
        at each new assignment. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A knowledge modeling 
        effort to demonstrate the feasibility of eliciting and representing local 
        meteorological expertise was undertaken at the Naval Training Meteorology 
        and Oceanography Facility (NTMOF) at Pensacola Naval Air Station, Pensacola, 
        FL <a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#14">[14]</a>. Figure 2 presents a depiction of a small but 
        typical part of the knowledge model that was created. The Concept Map 
        labeled "Gulf Coast Region Weather Forecasting" is the top-level 
        map for the model. In front of the top-level map is a more detailed one 
        on the topic of thunderstorms in the Gulf Coast region. Also appearing 
        are other resources that have been accessed, including the text labeled 
        "Thunderstorms," graphics (Annual Frequency of Thunderstorms), 
        satellite imagery, and a digital video of an expert discussing local seasonal 
        variations in thunderstorms.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Knowledge elicitation 
        for the creation of this model primarily utilized concept mapping as a 
        scaffold for structured interviews. A total of 26 Concept Maps on topics 
        such as the local climate, the effects of the Gulf of Mexico on the weather, 
        the various seasonal regimes, fog, thunderstorms, hurricanes, frontal 
        passage, and the local authority's tools and products were created from 
        several iterations of interviews with nine meteorologists. The knowledge 
        model was developed iteratively with review of the Concept Maps after 
        each wave of elicitation, and the assessment of potential resources that 
        could be included in the representation. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many pre-existing 
        resources such as graphics from the personal collections of the forecasters, 
        links to useful Web sites, etc., were identified and incorporated into 
        the model. Additionally, all the materials from the NTMOF "Local 
        Forecaster's Handbook" were included. Other information such as the 
        Standard Operating Procedures of the installation was attached at appropriate 
        places in the model. A substantial amount of digital video was created 
        from experts' discussions of topics of interest (thunderstorms, hurricanes, 
        fog, etc.) and included. A total of more than 400 information resources 
        were added to the model.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As the project proceeded, 
        verification was performed in two ways. First, the emerging knowledge 
        model was reviewed with the experts to monitor how the model was structured 
        by the Concept Maps. Second, independent verification of the Concept Maps 
        was performed. An independent expert worked through all the elicited Concept 
        Maps, looking for poorly described phenomena and errors. A study of this 
        part of the process showed that experts could evaluate the propositional 
        content in Concept Maps at the rate of approximately 7 propositions per 
        minute. The typical map size was approximately 47 propositions. Approximately 
        10% of the concepts and linking phrases were changed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Resource-appended 
        Concept Maps make useful, highly accessible learning resources. Subsequent 
        to the creation of the meteorology model described here, several new arrivals 
        at the installation (journeymen forecasters) used the system as part of 
        the preparation for the Sub-regional Forecaster qualification examination. 
        One of the users described the system as a game for browsing and resource 
        navigation. He recommended that all new arrivals train using the knowledge 
        model as an adjunct to the traditional learning materials. Another user 
        of the system made the distinction between "academic" meteorology 
        and "Operational" meteorology. He stated that the academic part 
        of learning to forecast is typically quite tedious and uninteresting, 
        whereas the operational aspects of working the data and making a forecast 
        were very interesting. He stated further that the current system served 
        an academic purpose while couching the academic part in a much more operational 
        setting, thereby making the system both more effective and enjoyable to 
        use.</font><br>

      <h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">4. Summary and Conclusions</font></h1>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper contains 
        a report of a knowledge modeling method named PreSERVe - Prepare, Scope, 
        Elicit, Render, Verify - an iterative method of knowledge elicitation, 
        construction and verification that can be used for knowledge modeling. 
        The paper also discusses the use of this method to create a Concept Map-based 
        knowledge model that captured expert knowledge pertaining to local effects 
        on weather forecasting in the Pensacola region of the Gulf Coast. The 
        knowledge model described in this paper was deployed and used by new arrivals 
        at the installation to help them fulfill their first responsibility of 
        qualifying to become Sub-regional forecasters.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Traditionally, knowledge 
        elicitation has been conceived as a sequential process with a pre-defined 
        goal. For example, one elicits knowledge and then does something with 
        it such as building an expert system. In the broader context of modeling 
        expert knowledge, the purposes are often less clear at the outset. It 
        can be difficult to determine the scope of the undertaking in the initial 
        stages of the endeavor for at least two reasons. </font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Such an effort 
        is typically the first time the expert has attempted to articulate the 
        nature of his or her expertise. <br>
        2. It has been shown that the more significant the expertise, the more 
        difficult it is for the expert to articulate<a href="http://www.ihmc.us/users/acanas/Publications/IKS2002/IKS.htm#13"> [13]</a>. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The iterative nature 
        of the PreSERVe method addresses these difficulties since expert review 
        of the emerging knowledge model allows the expert to reflect on the representation 
        and identify places that might be improved or corrected. Additionally, 
        the iterative approach to model creation and verification introduces efficiencies 
        into the process since it is easier to assess the increments in the model 
        than to attempt to verify a large, monolithic entity all at once at the 
        end of the knowledge modeling process.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As this and other 
        knowledge modeling projects have proceeded, it has become evident that 
        the "real" expertise is not in the documents, texts, or even 
        the procedural handbooks that the experts use, but rather in bits and 
        pieces of these, organized to support the heuristic knowledge elicited 
        to tie them all together. It is just such a construction of knowledge 
        that the PreSERVe method supports.<br>
        As an example, the Navy Gulf Coast Forecasting Handbook discusses a great 
        many details about fog and moisture advection, but does not mention the 
        important forecasters' heuristic to look across the airfield to see where 
        the fog ceiling falls relative to the tree heights to estimate the time 
        when fog will lift sufficiently so that training flights are permitted. 
        Such informal knowledge is of significant importance to newer forecasters 
        who experience pressure to attain competent job performance quickly.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This method is not 
        without drawbacks. Even though it creates efficiencies in the assembly 
        of content-rich knowledge models, such efforts remain quite time and effort 
        intensive. A second issue is model maintenance. If a knowledge model is 
        mainly of an historical nature (such as for institutional memory preservation), 
        the model might remain timely indefinitely. However, the more rapidly 
        the domain changes, the greater the maintenance problem becomes. Knowledge 
        models tend to have some relatively static components and other more dynamically 
        changing ones. A partial solution to the maintenance problem is the attachment 
        of a &lt;volatility&gt; attribute to resource descriptors to foster identification 
        of those resources that potentially change rapidly. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PreSERVe method 
        is viewed as one among a number of human-centric and machine-centric knowledge 
        management strategies. Knowledge modeling can be employed as one component 
        of strategic knowledge management and sharing. A final benefit of this 
        approach to elicitation and representation of expert knowledge is the 
        breadth of applicability of the final product. In particular, it can be 
        used to support activities such as the preservation of institutional memory, 
        the "recovery" of expertise that might reside in less accessible 
        forms such as archived documents, for performance support, and for other 
        knowledge-intensive pursuits. The content in traditional training or education 
        programs can be augmented or possibly even replaced with well-organized 
        expert practitioner knowledge. The advent of the World Wide Web revolutionizes 
        the use and distribution of such knowledge.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A software suite 
        entitled CMapTools has been created to provide the capability to create 
        knowledge models of the sort described here. The client software allows 
        the Concept Maps themselves to be created and populated with other resources 
        such as text, graphics, video, Web pages, etc. The CmapTools server allows 
        all these resources to reside across multiple machines and to be edited 
        or browsed from any machine that is running the CMapTools client program. 
        Currently, the software may be downloaded for educational and not-for-profit 
        use from the IHMC website. The URL for this Website is <a href="http://cmap.coginst.uwf.edu/">http://cmap.coginst.uwf.edu</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With CMapTools, knowledge 
        models may be shared throughout an organization and may be accessed anytime 
        and anywhere that permits (and that can be permitted) a connection to 
        the server where the model resides. Knowledge models can be evolved dynamically. 
        As an example from the meteorology work described here, forecasters who 
        have an unusually interesting forecast problem of the day quickly and 
        easily edit a concept map pertaining to the problem, or add additional 
        resources or links to helpful on-line data into the resource database. 
        This activity makes existing and new knowledge available to anyone with 
        interest in or a need to know about the domain.<br>
