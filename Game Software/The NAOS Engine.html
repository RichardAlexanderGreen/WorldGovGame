             <b>Description in Brief</b>
                <p>The NAOS Engine™ (pronounced like "chaos") is a highly scalable, client/server game
                engine, designed to support a very large MMORPG. 
                Continuously developed and refined for our own game, 
                <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohL70R0ohNQ">
                <i>Vendetta Online</i></a>, the engine has been
                proven through years of usage and expansion (public Alpha 
                in May of 2002, retail game launch in 2004, and up
                to present-day). The game has over a million installs on
                Android alone, has been the subject of
                <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1USoUGpPBk8">
                major television commercials</a>, and was the first MMO
                to officially launch support for the
                <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/24/4552076/vendetta-online-takes-its-digital-galaxies-to-oculus-rift">
                Oculus Rift</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Our engine client supports Windows, WinRT/Win8, Mac,
                Linux, iOS and Android™, with rendering drivers for DirectX (11 and
                9), OpenGL and
                OpenGL ES 2.0. The server is intended for distributed use
                across a cluster running FreeBSD or Linux, and has been
                elastically implemented on Amazon EC2. We are currently in 
                the process of making this engine available as a licensed 
                middleware product.</p>

	<p><b>We're MMO developers, so we call the "3D/game engine" the
	"client"</b>, to differentiate from the "server". Just to clarify for
	the mobile-reader, this "Client Engine" area basically equates to
	what most other companies call their entire "engine". <b>Our engine
	can be used for anything, not just MMOs, it's very flexible</b>.
	Here are a few features:</p>

	<ul class="bullet">
        <li class="bullet"> Build targets for Windows, WinRT/Win8, MacOS X, Linux, iOS and Android™. 
        Big and little endian, 64bit clean.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> C++ based low-level functionality, with Lua on top. Much "game"
        and UI work can be done entirely in Lua.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Fully native DirectX (11 and 9), OpenGL and OpenGL ES 2.0 renderers available; complete separation of
        engine function calls from low-level APIs, to allow simplicity of
        future renderer development.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Proven UDP game protocol, with custom guaranteed packet delivery,
        retransmission and sequencing figures. MTU discovery automatically
        optimizes for connection, proven through a vast number of consumer
        routers and the greater 'net (easily user-disabled as well). Custom 
        packet compression can be optimized to the specific stream profile 
        with genetic algorithms. Strong but fast encryption also available.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Compressed data file format, allowing all art assets and other
        information to be rolled into a single compressed file, with
        optional encryption also available.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Portable rendering engine supports progressive/continuous and
        discrete LOD, gamma correct rendering, material-based and
        object-hierarchy based scene graphs, multitude of shaders,
        compressed color and normal maps, animating textures, PNG with
        alpha, JPEG loading, etc.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Optimized OBB and primitive based collision detection
	system.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Physics engine supports polygon soup collision meshes, first point
        of contact, center of mass calculations, conservation of momentum,
        etc.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Advanced particle/FX system, with hierarchical effect definitions,
        envelopes, particle emitters may other particle emitters, etc.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> UI with fully featured interface controls, scroll regions, tree
        controls, list controls, drag-and-drop, etc.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Spatial partitioning implementations via both Octree and
        Sweep-and-Prune (performance tradeoffs for either depending on usage).</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Portable sound system with stereo floating-point mixer, arbitrary
        number of simultaneous sounds, doppler effect, 3D positional sound
        (outputs to stereo). Integrated OGG/Vorbis support.</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Platform-specific sound drivers for Linux, Mac, Windows (Wave-out,
        DirectX, Vista/7) allows hardware features to be kept separate from
        portable code, simplifies adding new sound support.</li>
	<li class="bullet">Scales very well across a variety of hardware
	(depending on art content used and implementation methods). Vendetta Online
	can run on a low-end smartphone, and still look cool on a heavyweight
	gaming desktop. Client engine also applicable to single-player or non-MMO development.
        </li><li class="bullet"> Optional hooks for the TeamSpeak 3 SDK
	(implementations both server and client side) allows for integrated
	voice chat across all client platforms.
	</li></ul>
	<p><b>Beyond this, there is an entire <i>art pipeline</i></b>, with a whole
        suite of custom tools (available for Win/Mac/Linux) to help artists
        build and prototype their assets, visual effects, and other
        features. Custom export plugins are available for 3D packages, etc.</p>

		<b>The Basic Architecture</b>
                <p><i>Vendetta Online</i> was conceived as a single-server,
                non-sharded game universe of potentially unlimited scale.
                Although our engine would work equally well with sharded
                designs (sharding is much easier), this historical point is
                mentioned to help illustrate the background of our architectural
                choices. The server-side needed to be able to scale
                effectively to a very large simultaneous-player capacity,
                while the client-side needed playability across a broad range 
                of available hardware. We began development in 1998, during
                the modem era, so a strong emphasis was placed on network protocol
                efficiency; in later years this has helped us to pack a
                great deal more activity into a smaller amount of per-client
                bandwidth, a feature of particular value on mobile wireless
                networks. (We have also elastically implemented the server on
                Amazon EC2).</p>
                <p>Like many live MMO products, <i>Vendetta Online</i> is still
                undergoing a process of continual refinement, so some
                aspects of architecture may fluctuate over time. That being
                said, here are some basics:</p>
                <b>The Server</b>
		<ul class="bullet">
		<li class="bullet">The <i>Core Packet Router</i>, uses tightly
                optimized C++ with administrative Lua on top, and handles player
                connection aggregation and logins. Per-user packet queues
                allow variable rate shaping, packet re-ordering and
                optimization (newer update replaces unsent older update).
                Realtime datastream compression further improves bandwidth
                usage, compression tables may be genetically optimized to 
                common packet use cases. Connections to Players, Kourier 
                (Erlang), Sector Daemons, and the SQL server are maintained. 
                Features built-in webserver with admin functionality.</li>
<img src="./The NAOS Engine_files/server.arch.png" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;padding-right:5px;" width="300" height="217" alt="Naos Server Architecture">
                <li class="bullet">The <i>Sector Daemon</i> actively
                controls an area of game geography, written in C++ and Lua. 
                <i>Vendetta Online</i> is made up of over 7,000 different 
                "sectors"; only those with players in them are "awake" and 
                running at any given time. The SD can control any physically 
                sized region, and handles the server-side of intensive tasks
                such as collision detection, physics, and low-level AI (PRM
                pathfinding, etc). SDs are distributed across a large
                cluster based on monitored per-machine CPU and memory load,
                with SDs transparently started as needed by players in the
                game, and shut down after "idle" parameters are met. Any
                number of sectors are possible, allowing for a game universe
                of near-infinite scale.</li>
                <li class="bullet"><i>Kourier</i> is the moniker given to
                our Erlang-based subsystem, used by us to control
                large-scale gameplay and AI. For example, an individual
                <i>Sector Daemon</i> may handle the low-level AI for a given
                set of NPCs, perhaps a hundred or so in a specific region, 
                having them react to various input criteria and other areas
                requiring high performance. Kourier, on the other hand,
                manages the high-level behaviour across <i>tens of 
                thousands</i> of NPCs, commanding them on a larger scale and 
                managing the behaviour of armies, nations, economies, and
                the like.
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29">
                Erlang</a> is a highly-scalable functional language and
                runtime system, originally developed for use with always-on
                phone switches made by Ericsson. Distributed usage and
                lightweight threading are two of its core properties, making
                it ideal for our application. Using this, we can maintain
                persistent threads for <i>every</i> NPC, as well as many
                other game cases, with minimal overhead and great
                scalability. Should the NPC be unneeded, such as being
                located in a non-running sector, the thread can be
                <i>hibernated</i>, reducing the overhead even further.
                <i>Vendetta Online</i> often has tens of thousands of
                NPCs in production at any given time; beyond this we have tested
                the <i>Kourier</i> system with over a million NPCs at a 10x 
                simulation rate, without issue (each NPC
		using two unique threads, on a single quad-core machine with 
		4GB of ram), and we expect it to
		scale far beyond that point. Kourier also includes an
                advanced binary logging system, capable of recording
                thousands of events per second, which can be used as a kind
                of chronological database, allowing one to view only what is
                pertinent to the task at hand.</li>
                

<!--		<b>The Server</b>
		<p>The "game server", to which the player connects, is made 
		up of three discrete areas of functionality, intended to be 
		distributed across a server cluster:</p>
                <ul class="bullet">
                <li class="bullet">The <i>Core Packet Router</i> is a piece of
                tightly optimized C++ code, which handles initial player
                login and authentication, as well as connection aggregation
                and datastream queues. Among other things, this includes
                optimization of the queue, such that more recent packets of
                duplicate type (such as movement updates for a given object)
                can replace older packets that are still waiting in the
                queue. The queueing system inherently allows a degree of
                simple rate-limiting to be applied to any given user
                connection. Additionally, the Core Packet Router applies
                realtime compression to the datastream; we used genetic
                algorithms to tailor the compression tables specifically to
                our common packet use cases (these tables could be
                re-optimized by licensees). On top of the C++ code sits a
                Lua layer for administrative use, as well as connections to
                Erlang and the SQL server.</li>
                <li class="bullet">
	<ul class="bullet">
        <li class="bullet"> Runs on Linux and FreeBSD (we currently use FreeBSD in production,
        but maintain active Linux development servers as well).</li>
        <li class="bullet"> Highly optimized core server code (C++) handles packet
        queue and prioritization, optimizes use of per-client bandwidth,
        replaces older queued packets with newer, compresses datastream in
        real time. Built-in administrative webserver, Lua and Erlang bindings
        simplify maintenance and live "hot" expansion.</li>

        <li class="bullet"> AI with PRM-based pathfinding.</li>

<p><b>"But how much will this cost?"</b> is the obvious question. We've
kicked around a number of notions for this, and recently come to the following
<i>(this is still in flux, and subject to change)</i>:

</p><ul>
<li><b>The client 3D/game engine will be free</b> for single-player and
two-player games (in binary/library form). This includes <i>all platforms</i>:
Win, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, WinRT.
You can ship any kind of single-player or two-player titles you want, in any
quantity, with no revshare or licensing fees, <i>forever</i>. If you're
looking to make 90% of the mobile or indie games out there, and comparing engines,
that basically means you get the "engine" for free. Build the next Angry
Birds, make a zillion dollars, we wish you the best.</li>
<li><b>If you want to build a real multi-player game</b>, or add serious
multi-player features, we'll ask you to work with our <i>NAOS Cloud</i>
offering (our NAOS Server hosted, by us, in the cloud). The NAOS Cloud will
basically bill you at close to our "cost" for the monthly bandwidth, CPU usage
and server resources used by your title. Beyond this, we'll ask for revenue
share on a slow curve that will scale with your gross revenue, starting out
very small when your revenues are small and staying small as you grow. If you
make over a million dollars US per year, our rev-share will peak at 10% of
the money you actually make as a developer (what you are actually paid,
across all types of revenue streams from the title, after the cuts and fees
from App Stores and advertising networks and the like).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>"But how can you afford to do this?"</b> is the next question. The
above proposal differs quite a bit from the norm; we're basically "giving
away" what everyone else sells as "the engine".</p>
<p>The simple answer is: <i>we're game developers</i>. We made this engine
to help us achieve our goals in game development, and games like <i>Vendetta
Online</i> are where we make our money. Thus, we can give away the engine
itself without really impacting our bottom line. We also have quite a low
overhead, which we'll continue while rolling out this engine. We aren't
likely to spend money on an expensive booth at GDC; we think developers
would rather just try the product themselves and make their own decisions.</p>

<p><b>"What if I want a specific feature? Or support? Or a source
license?"</b> We can accomodate those things. We're always going to be
improving the engine anyway (for our own usage), and if the community wants
a higher priority on something, we can potentially post a bounty for that
feature (the associated development costs for us to add it more quickly), and let the
community crowdfund the improvement.</p>

<p>Beyond this, we can do source-licenses and support a-la carte, but our
main goals here will be the creation of a moderately self-supporting online
community, built around the "free" binary/library engine-license. As MMO developers,
creating this kind of community is pretty familiar territory for us.</p>

<p><b>Other on-going improvements to the engine</b> will continue to get
released over time, for free, as we make changes for our own development
usage (our own games).</p>
